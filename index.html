  <h3> Initial Assault and Deception</h3>
    <h4>The earliest example of initial assault dates back to Gideon and the Israelites. Gideon needed the Israelites help to kick the Midianites out of there land. Gideon told most of his men to go to the east and wait for the Midianites there. Only 300 men stayed with Gideon and then, they attacked the Midianites camp. This is called intial assault. 
      When a smaller group of people attack the enemy camp and force them to another direction. Gideon and his men drove the Midianites to the east where the rest of the army was waiting and the Midianites were slaughtered.

    <h4>Another example of initial assault is perhaps the most famous, the Trojan Horse. The Myceaneans gave a large wooden horse to the 
      Trojans and the Myceanean fleet set off back home, but not for long. The Trojans did not realize that inside the horse were soldiers silently waiting to be let out. One of the soldiers went and lit a fire on the tomb of Achilles, a Myceanean hero, that signaled the fleet to come back. Since the Trojans were all tired from celebrating their victory, the Myceaneans inside the horse rampaged through the city. By the time the Trojans had gathered enough forces, the Myceanean fleet had already returned and the Trojans lost the war.

  <h3>Signals and Ciphers</h3>
  <img src="http://www.civilwarsignals.org/pages/crypto/disk/usadisklg.jpg">
  <h4>
    Signals and Ciphers are perhaps some of the oldest yet invaluable sources of secretive communication. Although there are new ways for secretive communication such as carrier pigeons and flag signaling(it was there in the olden days), none of those were really effective or reliable.
     During the Civil war, the Union troops used the wig-wag system. They would encode messages through flag signaling, but however, to make it foolproof, the army used a cipher disk. A cipher disk is made up of two movable wheels. 
     The inner wheel shows letters of the alphabet in a random order. The outer wheel contains another random alphabet but this time with numbers. To send messages the sender an the receiver had to know the key.
  </h4>
  <h4>
    The Confederate troops did rely on a cipher, just a different kind. The Vigenere cipher, an Italian creation, required a key as with the cipher disk. Ciphers and Signals were extremely important in wartime deception, especially in delivering secretive messages.
  </h4>
  <h4>
    Signals and Ciphers were also used in the World Wars. On fact, the only code the Germans couldn't break was from the Navajos. The Navajos were recruited into the army, and their code was basically their language. The Axis powers did not know the Navajo language so therefore, they could speak freely without the Germans finding out.

  <h3>Camouflage and Haversacks</h3>
  <img src="http://cdn.playbuzz.com/cdn/5f6adf33-52b3-45e2-8d9b-2f5126b86c3e/2560e338-90a0-43c5-8bdf-9f159a43ad88.jpg">
  <h4>
    Camouflage is and was an important form of deception. The British military was particularly good at it. The enlisted artists to help them.
    Artists were a very important part of camouflage. They worked on the right colors so that the troops would not be spotted. The British War Office created camouflage trees. There a soldier could hide and be on lookout without anyone spotting them. Haversacks were basically camouflaged knapsacks that are used in covert operations today. They help a soldier not get spotted during battle or missions.
  </h4>
  <h4>
   Crypsis and Mimesis were the two types of animal camouflage. Crypsis is when you blend into the background, and mimesis is when something acts like another thing that its not. Its basically a fox in a sheep's clothing. Crypsis was perhaps the most effective form of camouflage, just blending into the nature. In fact, crypsis is what we use most regularly. You could say that we do use mimesis during war, what with spies infiltrating the other countries.
  </h4>
  <h4>The British Army successfully used camouflage to sink German U-boats in World War 1. They were called Q-ships and were freight or cargo ships. The appearance was deceiving but hidden inside were hundreds of guns.

  <h3>Operation Bodyguard</h3>
    <img src="https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://i0.wp.com/www.cienciahistorica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/operation-bodyguard.jpg?resize=300%2C300">
      <h4>
Operation Bodyguard was implemented during the time where Germany was on the winning side of World War 2, in around 1943. The Allies were trying to launch an attack on the west side of Europe. 
Hitler knew that they were trying to but he didn't know when or where. Winston Churchill knew this and used it to their advantage. 
The Allies needed to send a fake message to Germany about the location and the time. This attack was maybe the most important attack in the whole war because the Allies needed this to go well to win the war. Hitler decided to spread his troops wide which the Allies used because less people = easier attack.
The original plan was to drop bombs on Germany, but the leaders of the Allies were displeased by that. They needed something quick something to make Hitler and Germany lose hope. They were planning an invasion of 
France, but first they needed to use deception.The five areas everyone needed to consider were these:
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Intelligence Gathering</li>
        <li>Counterintelligence Activities</li>
        <li>Special Operations</li>
        <li>Political Warfare</li>
        <li>The Deception Itself</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>
        The three main objectives of Operation Bodyguard were to make Pas de Calais appear to be the place of the attack but actually the attack would actually happen 200 mile south of Normandy. The second objective was to make sure that Hitler kept his troops at Pas de Calais. The third was obvious. Don't let Hitler know about the different location. There were several other deception operations in World War 2, but Operation Bodyguard raised the word deception to a whole new level.

          <h3>The Ghost Army</h3>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Ghostarmypatch.jpg">
     
        <h4>
          The ghost army was another important aspect of deception in World War 2. The ghost army was an army just not one that fought, it was one that deceived. The Allies recruited artists, designers,sound specialists and animators to make the ghost army. There were 1,100 soldiers in the army, and they fooled the Germans so badly everybody was laughing for ages afterward. What they did was, using inflatable tanks, sound effects, and some artwork, fooled the German troops into thinking that their were 10,000 people instead of just 1,100.

  Deception has not been used much after the World Wars because of nuclear weapons, although there have been some fabulous plays in the Gulf War and the Korean War though none really as impressive as the ones before them. If you are interested in learning more about them here are the links below.
